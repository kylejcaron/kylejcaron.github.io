# About Me

I'm currently a Data Scientist in industry interested in causal inference anything Bayes. Lately I've found myself much more focused on learning business applications for data science, advanced experimentation and policy evaluation, and advantages of statistical models over machine learning. While I'm not an expert, I do enjoy mentoring and teaching.
