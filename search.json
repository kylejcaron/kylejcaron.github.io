    "text": "Explainable AI is all the rage these days. Black box ML models come along with some fun tools such as LIME, SHAP, or Partial Depence Plots that try to give visibility into how the model is interpreting data and making predictions. It’s a common misconception that these are causal inference techniques - sadly we’ve all been mislead.\nWe’re going to walk through an example that shows these tools fall victim to the same rules of causal inference as everything else. A confound is still a confound, and if you want to measure some causal effect there’s still no way around that without careful deliberation of which variables to include in your models.\nThe code for this blogpost can be found here\n\nStarting simple: simulating some fake data\nLet’s start with a simple scenario. Our goal is to estimate some causal effects. We’re going to simulate out data ourself so we know the true causal effects. We can see how good some popular “explainable AI” algorithms actually are at causal inference. We’ll simulate data from the following DAG:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s a DAG? A dag is a directed acyclic graph, or fancy talk for a flowchart that goes in 1 direction. It’s really just a diagram of a true data generating process. They’re typically assumed based on domain knowledge (like all models), although ocassionally there are some validation checks you can perform.\nEdges in the graph are assumed to be true causal effects. So for example,\n\nX3 influences Y\nX5 influences X1 which influences Y\nSome unobserved variable U influences both X1 and Y. By unobserved, what I mean is that its some variable we don’t have data for.\n\nFor those familiar with causal inference, this DAG in particular is also riddled with confounds.\n\nOk back on track. We’ll get out one of the more popular Explainable AI tools nowadays, XGBoost. I’m going to start in the most dangerous way possible - I’m going to toss everything in the model.\n\n\nTest 1: What’s the impact of X1 on Y?\nWe know for a fact that X1 influences Y. Let’s see how well Partial Dependence Plots and SHAP values do at identifying the true causal effect\n\n\n\n\n\nThese SHAP values arent just wrong, but the effect is in the wrong direction. The reason for this: there’s a Fork Confound.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome variable Z confounds Xs true effect on Y.\n\nA very common example of a fork confound is warm weather (Z) on the relationship between ice cream sales (X) and crime (Y). Ice cream sales obviously have no influence on crime, but ice cream sales are higher during warmer weather, and crime is higher during warmer weather.\n\nSo back to our main point - Explainable AI can’t get around a fork confound. This is our first lesson on why SHAP / explainable AI is different from causal inference.\nLuckily in this case, statistics can solve this problem.\nUsing some domain knowledge about the generating process, we notice an instrument, X5, that can be used to estimate the causal effect of X1 on Y\n\n\n\n\n\nI won’t go into the details of instrumental variable analysis since the goal of this article is to highlight that Explainable AI can’t replace causal inference. To learn more about it, see Scott Cunningham’s Causal Inference the Mixtape.\nBut for now, I will show that a classic causal inference method succeeds where XGBoost and SHAP values fail\nfrom linearmodels import IV2SLS\nfrom src.dagtools import get_effect\n\n# Instrumental variable analysis\niv_model = IV2SLS.from_formula(\"Y ~ 1 + [X1 ~ X5]\", data=df).fit()\n\n# pull true effect\ntrue_effect = get_effect(DAG, \"X1\", \"Y\")\n\n# Plot\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(6,4))\nax.set_title(\"Instrumental Variable Analysis\\nRecovers True effect\")\nplot_model_estimate(iv_model, true_effect=true_effect, feat=\"X1\", ax=ax)\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see, a simple statistics technique succeeds where explainable AI fails.\n\n\nWhat about estimating the effect of X4 on Y?\nThis relationship is slightly more complicated, but certainly measurable. X4 influences X2 which influences Y. Here’s the DAG again for reference\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plots below show how well explainable AI does at estimating the causal effect of this relationship.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, they don’t pick up an effect at all! And if our goal was to increase Y we’d end up missing a pretty good lever for it. There’s another simple explanation here for why explainable AI: there’s a Pipe Confound\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen trying to measure the effect of X -&gt; Y, conditioning on Z (aka including it in a model as a covariate with X) ends up blocking inference.\nFor more details on how a Pipe confound works, I recommend chapters 5 and 6 of Richard McElreath’s Statistical Rethinking v2 (where I borrowed the example from as well).\nThe main things to note here are that pipes are common and Explainable AI doesn’t get around them.\nWe can recover an unbiased estimate of the true effect simply with OLS\n# Fit simple OLS model\nmodel = sm.OLS.from_formula(\"Y ~ X4\", data=df).fit()\n\n# pull true effect\ntrue_effect = get_effect(DAG, \"X4\", \"X2\") * get_effect(DAG, \"X2\", \"Y\")\n\n# Plot (see notebok for plot_model_estimate function)\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(6,4))\nax.set_title(\"Instrumental Variable Analysis\\nRecovers True effect\")\nplot_model_estimate(model, true_effect=true_effect, feat=\"X4\", ax=ax)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan we use Explainable AI for causal inference at all?\nWe can! We just need to be deliberate in which variables we include in our models, and the only way to do that right is to use DAGs! The example below looks at an XGBoost model that doesnt condition on X2 (allowing us to estimate the causal effect of X4 -&gt; Y).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTake Aways\nExplainable AI is not some magic tool for causal inference. What these tools are good at is explaining why complicated models make the decisions they do. Explainable AI tools suffer from the same limitations for causal inference as all other statistical estimators.\nAt the end of the day when causal inference is your goal, nothing beats using DAGs to inform deliberate variable selection.\nIf you’re new to the subject, I highly recommend the following resources that will teach you how to use causal inference properly:\n\nChapter’s 5 and 6 of Statistical Rethinking v2, by Richard McElreath\nCausal Inference for the Brave and True by Matheus Facure\nCausal Inference the Mixtape, by Scott Cunningham"

In reality, frequentist power analyses assume that the null hypothesis is correct, which isn’t quite what we want, not to mention, frequentist power analyses use backwards probabilities which are just plain confusing - see here to for more\n\nNote that we’re prioritizing power here for a reason.

HTEs are just a fancy way of saying the personalized effect, aka promos might be more impactful for some users than others.\nSo how does this relate to what we did before? Well when we tried to compare users who saw the treatment vs. those that didnt\n\\[\n\\text{SDO} = E[ Y(1) | T = 1 ] - E[ Y(0) | T = 0 ]\n\\]\nwe didnt take into account the fact that users who saw the treatment tend to be different than those who didn’t. Users who saw the treatment tend to be more unhappy by design.\nSo if we subtract out the selection bias from the SDO (I got this via simple algebra), aka we control for the unhappiness between customers, we can get closer to identifying the true ATE.\nNote that selection bias was \\[\nE\\big[Y(0)\\mid T=1\\big] - E\\big[Y(0)\\mid T=0\\big]\n\\]\nThis is just saying selection bias is the fundamental difference between users who get picked for treatment vs. those who dont.\nIn our case, the fundamental difference between whether users are selected for treatment is based upon their unhappiness. So if we can subtract out the effect of unhappiness, we can subtract out the selection bias\n\ndf.groupby(\"T\").mean()[[\"upset\"]].T\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT\n0\n1\n\n\n\n\nupset\n-0.159046\n1.018004\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can do this with OLS. The most obvious way is to fit a model relating unhappiness to LTV, and then subtract out that effect.\n\nmodel1 = sm.OLS.from_formula(\"Y ~ upset\", data=df.loc[lambda d: d[\"T\"]==0]).fit()\nY0_hat = model1.predict(df)\n\nselection_bias = (\n    df.assign(selection_bias = Y0_hat)\n    .groupby(\"T\").mean()\n    [[\"selection_bias\"]]\n)\nselection_bias.T.round(2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nT\n0\n1\n\n\n\n\nselection_bias\n2579.46\n1990.96\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally we can subtract out the effect, ending up with an estimate very close to the true ATE of 500\n\n(\n    df.assign(selection_bias = Y0_hat)\n    .groupby(\"T\").mean()[[\"Y\", \"selection_bias\"]].T\n    .assign(difference = lambda d: d[1] - d[0])\n    [[\"difference\"]].T\n    .reset_index(drop=True)\n    .rename(columns={\"Y\":\"SDO\"})\n    .assign(tau = lambda d: d.SDO - d.selection_bias)\n    .round(2)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSDO\nselection_bias\ntau\n\n\n\n\n0\n-87.98\n-588.5\n500.52\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s actually an even more simple way to control for selection bias - it can just be included as a term in an OLS regression model.\n\ndef statsmodels_to_df(model):\n    table = np.array(model.summary().tables[1].data)\n    return pd.DataFrame(table[1:, 1:], columns=table[0,1:], index=table[1:,0])\n\nmodel2 = sm.OLS.from_formula(\" Y ~ T + upset\", data=df).fit()\nstatsmodels_to_df(model2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncoef\nstd err\nt\nP&gt;|t|\n[0.025\n0.975]\n\n\n\n\nIntercept\n2499.9363\n0.516\n4847.317\n0.000\n2498.925\n2500.947\n\n\nT\n500.5529\n1.502\n333.191\n0.000\n497.608\n503.497\n\n\nupset\n-500.0068\n0.518\n-965.940\n0.000\n-501.021\n-498.992\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see above the estimate of the treatment effect is the beta coefficient for T and it closely matches our manual estimate above."

    "text": "A quick note on Heterogeneous Treatment Effects\nWe’ve controlled for selection bias, what about Heterogeneous Treatment Effect bias? We actually don’t need to control for these once we’ve controlled for selection bias. These average treatment effect ends up being the average of all of the HTEs of individuals, which is fine because as long as we’ve accounted for selection bias, the HTEs tend to cancel out. They’re essentially captured by the error term, \\(\\epsilon\\) in OLS \\[\ny = \\alpha + \\beta X + \\epsilon\n\\]\nWe can also see that in our code, where the distribution of true HTE bias from our hypothetical dataset is centered at zero. Any time we’ve accounted for all selection bias, the HTE should be zero centered and cancel itself out as N increases.\n\n\nCode\nATE = data[\"ITE\"].mean()\nHTE = data.ITE.values - ATE\nsns.histplot(HTE)\nplt.xlabel(\"HTE\")\nplt.title(\"Distribution of HTEs (each customers difference from the ATE)\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bias of HTEs for each person is just the distance their treatment effect is from the average treatment effect. Again, this follows the same property as the error term in OLS regression, which is why it can be such a powerful tool for causal inference when used correctly."

    "title": "Making out of sample predictions with PyMC",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nA cool thing about hierarchical models is that its easy to predict out of sample - i.e. if you want to make a prediction on a new zipcode, just sample from the state’s distribution (composed of the state average and variance across zip codes in that state).\nIn pymc3, it’s somewhat easy to accomplish this, but not as straightforward as we’d hope. This blog post will show a trick that lets you easily predict out of sample, and will reduce some of the overhead that comes from writing alot of custom prediction functions\n\n\nSimulating data\nI simulated a 2 level hierarchical model - for interpretability, I set it up as a state &gt; zipcode model. You can following along with the notebook here. The data is as follows\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing categorical variables\nCategorical variables are a somewhat new feature of pandas - they can store categories that aren’t in the observed data, and are an easy replacement for pd.factorize() (a common tool for those familiar with the bayesian workflow).\nWe can use these to trick pymc into thinking there’s a category with no observed data, and pymc ends up assigning the global distribution to that unobserved category, which we can simply reference in the future for any time we want to make a prediction on out of sample data.\n# Convert to categorical and add an `out_of_sample` category\ndf = df.assign(state = pd.Categorical(df.state).add_categories(\"out_of_sample\"))\\\n    .assign(zipcode = pd.Categorical(df.zipcode).add_categories(\"out_of_sample\"))\n\n\nFitting the model\nWe’ll use the codes from the categorical columns to index our model coefficients, and we’ll use the categories as coordinates for the model to map names to.\ncoords={\n    \"state\":df.state.cat.categories,\n    \"zipcode\":df.zipcode.cat.categories\n}\n\ndef hierarchical_normal(name, μ, dims):\n    '''Adapted from Austin Rochford'''\n    Δ = pm.Normal('Δ_{}'.format(name), 0., 1., dims=dims)\n    σ = pm.Exponential('σ_{}'.format(name), 2.5)\n    return pm.Deterministic(name, μ + Δ * σ, dims=dims)\n\n\nwith pm.Model(coords=coords) as model_nc:\n    \n    # Observed Data tracking\n    state_ = pm.Data(\"state_\", df.state.cat.codes)\n    zip_ = pm.Data(\"zip_\", df.zipcode.cat.codes)\n    obs = pm.Data(\"obs\", df.y)\n\n    # Hyperprior\n    mu_country = pm.Normal(\"mu_country\", 0, 1)\n    \n    # Prior\n    sig = pm.Exponential(\"sig\", 1)\n    \n    # Hierarchical coefficients\n    mu_state = hierarchical_normal(\"mu_state\", μ=mu_country, dims=\"state\")\n    mu_zipcode = hierarchical_normal(\"mu_zipcode\", μ=mu_state, dims=(\"zipcode\", \"state\") )\n    \n    # Observational model\n    y = pm.Normal(\"y\", mu_zipcode[zip_, state_], sig, observed=obs)\n    \n    # Fit \n    trace_nc = pm.sample(target_accept=0.9, return_inferencedata=True, random_seed=SEED)\nThere are a few key point that make out of sample prediction possible * Having the out_of_sample category for each indexed variable with no observed data * Passing the coords in the model statement * Using dims to reference which model coefficients have which coordinate labels * Having all of our input data wrapped in a pm.Data() statement\nThat last point is particularly important. For PyMC, if you want to make predictions on new data, you have to replace the data that the model references and the only way to do that (that I know of atleast) is to using a Theano shared variable. pm.Data() handles all of that fo you.\nSo we fit our model, lets take a quick look at the state level coefficients\npm.plot_forest(trace_nc, var_names=[\"mu_state\"])\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat, that out of sample variable seems to represent the global distribution across states - i.e. if we were to make a prediction for a new state we’d potentially use that distribtion (we’ll confirm further down).\nWe’ll check the zip code level below as well, looking at Maine specifically\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see, the out_of_sample variable has a sampled value despite there being no observed data for it. Now the question is, does this align with how we’d predict new data?\nLet’s try calculating coefficients out of sample by hand and see if it aligns with the out_of_sample values\npost = trace_nc.posterior\n\n# Pull the true data from our simulation\nstate_true = mu_state_true.random(size=4000)\n\n\n# Calculate out of sample state means by drawing from global distribution\nmu_country = post[\"mu_country\"].values.reshape(4000,-1)\nσ_state = post[\"σ_mu_state\"].values.reshape(4000,-1)\nmu_state = np.random.normal(mu_country, σ_state)\n\n# Using the indexing trick\nstate_idx_trick = post[\"mu_state\"].sel({\"state\":[\"out_of_sample\"]}).values.ravel()\n\n# Pull the true data from simulation\nzip_true = pm.Normal.dist(mu_state_true.random(size=4000), sig_zip_true).random(size=4000)\n\n# calculate out of sample mu by hand by drawing from out of sample state prediction above\nσ_zipcode = post[\"σ_mu_zipcode\"].values.reshape(4000,-1)\nmu_zipcode = np.random.normal(mu_state, σ_zipcode)\n\n# Use the indexing trick\nzip_idx_trick = (post[\"mu_zipcode\"]\n                .sel({\"state\":[\"out_of_sample\"], \"zipcode\":[\"out_of_sample\"]})\n                .values.ravel())\nWe can compare these results by plotting their distributions below\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the manual prediction and the indexing trick are basically identical. There’s a slight difference from the ground truth, but thats to be expected since we’re fitting a model on limited data (and anyway, it’s still quite close).\n\n\nPredicting out of sample\nLet’s go ahead and actually make prediction now - we’ll make predictions for the following data below\n\nThe first example is in sample\nThe second example is in sample for state, out of sample for zipcode\nThe third example is out of sample entirely\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd finally we’ll use the model to make predictions on this new data. Notice the pm.set_data() function - remember our pm.Data() calls from before? This tells PyMC to override that with new data, so when we sample from the posterior predictive it makes predictions on the new data instead of the data used to fit the model.\n\n\nClick here for helper function code\n\n# We're making some quick convenience functions to map this new data \n# to the proper indexes from the fitted model\nzip_lookup = dict(zip(df.zipcode.cat.categories, range(len(df.zipcode.cat.categories))))\nstate_lookup = dict(zip(df.state.cat.categories, range(len(df.state.cat.categories))))\n\ndef labels_to_index(series, lookup):\n    '''Converts categories to their proper codes'''\n    series = series.copy()\n    in_sample = series.isin(lookup.keys())\n    series.loc[~in_sample] = \"out_of_sample\"\n    return series.map(lookup).values.astype(\"int8\")\n\n\nwith model_nc:\n    # Set new data for the model to make predictions on\n    pm.set_data({\n        \"state_\": X.state.pipe(labels_to_index, state_lookup),\n        \"zip_\": X.zipcode.pipe(labels_to_index, zip_lookup)\n    })\n    \n    # make predictions\n    preds = pm.sample_posterior_predictive(trace_nc)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is exactly what we were looking for - and prediction is easy, just map any out of sample states or zipcodes to the out_of_sample category. Notice how in sample predictions have smaller uncertainty intervals and out of sample data is more uncertain - this is exactly what we’d expect. This trick makes it much easier to make predictions compared to having to write out a custom prediction function that follows the same logic as the model.\nIf you have any other easy tricks for out of sample prediction let me know!"

    "text": "Early stage needs - Starting Simple, Building trust\nWhen I joined the company, I was just the third data science hire, and there really wasn’t any experimentation practice in place beyond stakeholders watching an optimizely dashboard. Listening to stakeholders, there was a desire to build more trust in decision making and make sure their products decisions were actually improving things for the customer.\nWe started simple - a google doc template where stakeholders could explain the product feature they wanted to implement and their hypothesis on what outcome the product feature might improve. From there we worked with them to design a measurement strategy to answer their question, which wasn’t always an experiment. At the end of the day, experimentation is just one of many tools for causal inference. Having this process and flexibility helped us earn buy-in - we weren’t just there to tell them what we could and couldn’t do. We were there to educate so that we weren’t just recommending solutions, but so that stakeholders were playing a really active role in what our measurement strategy should be.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also improved the experiment output from an optimizely dashboard to an in-house report. All of this built alot more trust in the results, and helped us move on to new questions like\n\n“Can we use different outcome metrics beyond conversion rate?”\n“Can we make experiments shorter?” (power analyses, variance reduction)\n“Can we launch a feature without hurting the business even if we can’t confirm it’s better?”” (uncertainty quantification)\n“What’s the right risk tolerance in terms of being able to detect an effect versus risking a false positive” (here’s a fun example)\n“Can we start experimenting like this on our other products?”\n“Can we learn how our change in one part of the funnel may have an impact further downstream?”\n“How can we run experiments that mitigate regret?” (Bandit algorithms)\n“Can we stop an experiment early and still have confidence in the results?” (sequential testing, alpha spending)\n“Who is the experiment working best for?” ( Multiple Hypothesis Testing, Heterogeneous Treatment Effects )\n\nAgain, we weren’t just throwing cool implementations at them we thought they needed, we were listening to what our stakeholders wanted first and then prioritizing it. As we moved up the ladder in terms of trust, I was able to get buy in to build out scalable tooling for others in the company to start usin, and we were able to scale the process to other teams.\nThere was also 1 key tenant I tried to keep in mind as our methodology became more advanced: could we directly observe the treatment effect? (simple difference in outcomes). No matter how advanced of a method we might consider, throwing some output from a blackbox model at a stakeholder was never the way to go. It can’t be understated how important directly observing the treatment effect is for trust."

    "section": "What’s a surrogate index?",
    "text": "What’s a surrogate index?\nA surrogate index was a new piece of research from Susan Athey, basically a way to predict what a long term treatment effect would be given intermediate outcomes that could be observed sooner. It also neatly addressed the biggest problem we were facing.\nThe basic idea is illustrated in the DAG below.\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  B(Treatment) --&gt; c(Outcome 1)\n  B(Treatment) --&gt; d(Outcome 2)\n  B(Treatment) --&gt; e(Outcome 3)\n  c(Outcome 1) --&gt; f(Long Term\\nOutcome)\n  d(Outcome 2) --&gt; f(Long Term\\nOutcome)\n  e(Outcome 3) --&gt; f(Long Term\\nOutcome)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s say the long term outcome can be entirely explained by 3 intermediate outcomes, such as mid-funnel metrics that can be observed sooner. A model can be fit to that relationship on historical data like so:\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  c(Outcome 1) --&gt; f(Long Term\\nOutcome)\n  d(Outcome 2) --&gt; f(Long Term\\nOutcome)\n  e(Outcome 3) --&gt; f(Long Term\\nOutcome)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe set of intermediate outcomes is known as a surrogate index; they’re a surrogate for the long term outcome. If you have a correct model for the DAG above, than all you need to do is observe outcomes 1-3. You could then just run an experiment as you normally would, but instead of using some game-able mid-funnel metric as the primary outcome, you could measure outcomes 1-3 for both the treatment and control group, and predict what the long-term outcome would be for each group. The difference in the prediction for the treatment group and the control group ends up being identical to the true long-term treatment effect (assuming that the model and dag are specified correctly).\nAs always, it’s easier said than done. You need to make sure that the entire intermediate effect between the treatment and the long-term outcome is captured by the DAG and the model. Or in english, you need to understand the exact effect that the intermediate outcomes have on the long term outcome, and you need to be right about it; you can’t be missing anything.\nBut there are ways to validate you’re on the right track. First, knowing something about DAGs and causal inference, you can call on the local markov property; the treatment should be conditionally independent of the long term outcome after conditioning on the surrogate index. That’s easy to test. One can alse make predictions on the long term outcome with their surrogate index and see if it ended up being correct when the long-term outcome gets observed (hopefully for repeated experiments). Also do-able. Even better, if you have many historical experiments, you could do this validation on that dataset across all of the experiments.\n\n\nCode\n# for simplicity, not actually simulating a true data generating process\nnp.random.seed(99)\nx = np.random.normal(0,3,size=25)\ntrue_north_metric = x*1.4 + np.random.normal(0, 0.5, size=len(x))\npredicted_true_north = np.random.normal(true_north_metric, 1)\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(7,5))\nax.scatter(predicted_true_north, true_north_metric)\nax.plot([-8,7], [-8,7], ls='--')\n\nax.set_xticks([])\nax.set_yticks([])\nax.set(xlabel='Predicted True North', ylabel='True North Metric', title='Surrogate Index vs. Long Term Outcome over many experiments')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, we didn’t have a large dataset of historical experiments. For the experiments we did have, they didn’t have enough power to detect reasonably sized changes on our true-north bottom funnel metric. Those experiment had all been designed with mid-funnel metrics in mind, and therefore had smaller sample sizes."

    "section": "Building a plan",
    "text": "Building a plan\nIn total there were 5 big problems to address, each with a different solution. There also weren’t alot of resources to devote to them. But if we could free up time for others running experiments, they could use some of that time to contribute to this roadmap.\nIn the end, the biggest priority was to implement surrogate indices, because that was having the biggest painpoint on our business - we couldnt keep working with game-able metrics that weren’t improving the business.\nWith that in mind, switchback experimentation was in direct conflict with that goal. Switchback experiments don’t allow you to observe long term outcomes because users arent the ones who are randomized, time periods are what is randomized. We could atleast monitor and set up guardrails to make sure there wasnt alot of spillover.\nThis also meant that bandit algorithms shouldn’t be part of our toolkit any time soon, even though there had been alot of interest in them. Bandit algorithms wouldn’t be ideal for learning the impact on long term outcomes, and using them to learn a surrogate index would be really difficult since the treatment propensity would be constantly changing over time.\nI’ll summarize some of the easy and hard solutions I came up with:\n\nInfrastructure\n\nSolution: templated SQL for scalable experiment queries\n\n“Who did the experiment work best for?”\n\nEasy solution(s): Scalable code for Multiple hypothesis testing with corrections\nHard solution: Heterogeneuous Treatment Effect models\n\nSample Size problems\n\nEasy solution(s): Quickly implement Informative priors. Since we had revenue as part of our overall evaluation criteria for some experiments, this provided a massive speedup\nHard solution(s): CUPED, Cohort Models\n\nSpillover Effects\n\nEasy Solution(s): Monitoring, guardrails\nHard Solution(s): Switchback Experimentation Engine\n\nOptimizing for Long-term Outcomes\n\nEasy Solution(s): Cohort monitoring, Longer experiments, long term hold-out groups\nHard solution(s): Surrogate Index approach\n\n\nThe final proposed plan ended up being the following:\n\nPartner with the data team for each product pillar to build templated SQL for their experiments to save them time.\nAutomate the secondary analysis of experiments so that stakeholders could understand who the experiments worked best for. We actually chose the easy solution for this, multiple hypothesis testing with corrections. It was easy to implement it and it aligned with our principle of making sure the treatment effect is observable. Plus, if we ever got the point of heterogenous treatment effect modeling, it’d be alot more believeable for stakeholders if they could also look at the multiple hypothesis test reporting. This was a low lift way to free up the teams time and help our stakeholders answer what they wanted. Importantly, we lumped in metric observability with this so that we could understand which experiments were impacting which metrics.\nReduce experiment duration with informative priors and CUPED. Many experiments had an overall evaluation criteria that incorporated customer revenue, Customer revenue was wide-tailed (near lognormally distributed). Using priors was an incredibly easy and insanely effective way to reduce variance for experiments, speeding them up significantly. CUPED would be a way to take that even further. We planned for a data scientist to implement this with their newly freed up time after automating secondary analyses.\nSet up monitoring for spillover effects, but don’t implement switchback experiments.\nCenter the life-insurance product’s experimentation strategy around a surrogate index. This meant running longer experiments so that there was enough power to detect effects on the true north metric. Hopefully after 6 months, we’d have enough information to build a correct surrogate index to start using.\n\nThere was still a big red flag. We’d have to run longer experiments, and we’d have to wait atleast 6 months to even start using this. That was met with alot of hesitation. Deviating from 1-2 week experiment cadences admittedly sounds a bit nuts. Companies need to grow, and to do that they need to change and try new things. But at the same time we had a problem we couldn’t avoid - the simple fact of the matter was that if we wanted to have conviction in our product changes, we’d have to wait 3-6 months to actually observe its down funnel impact.\nWe decided to compromise rigor for speed. We planned to immediately implement a surrogate index based on the small amount of data we had, begin running experiments with enough power to detect an effect on our true north metric (3-4 weeks), and use the surrogate index, a guardrail, and our usual mid-funnel outcome as joint primary outcome metrics for upcoming experiments. While not ideal, it’d allow us to start using these ideas immediately, and we’d also be able to build up a better dataset of experiments so that even if the first iteration of the surrogate index didn’t work, we could eventually learn the correct one. That, and we’d have enough power to observe treatment effects on the long term outcome (after waiting a long time).\nReally, our overall strategy was a shift to improving observability. We created better observability on how experiments were affecting different outcomes and different customers and we created better observability on how our experiments were impacting our true north metric. The funny part is, early in my career I thought this was a big red flag - the more you observe the more likely you could be to identify a false positive. But thats impractical advice. You really have to be looking at the whole picture, that way you can start to understand the business and learn more. Just do so responsibly."

    "text": "The Problem: You work at a clothing rental service that is suffering from high periods of churn. You’ve found that stockouts are one of the biggest reasons for churn - despite having plenty of products, they tend to only be available 60-80% of the time. How can we determine how much stock to reorder?\nThe idea of this project is to borrow ideas from first principles modeling - basically think about the data generating process and model each step of it. This example borrows ideas from discrete choice literature, survival analysis, demand forecasting, and simulation.\nProducts with extreme stockouts have misleading demand estimates under classic demand models. The basis of these ideas is really simple. If we only have 5 units of a product in stock, and we saw 5 sales (or rentals in this case) that day, then we know that demand is atleast 5 rentals. Typical demand modeling might only look at the count of rentals each day, while censored demand modeling would look at both rental counts and stock levels, and incoporate both of these pieces of information.\nThe idea is to start simple(-ish) and add complexity. We’ll first model a single product and test different ordering policies, and then begin modeling multiple products.\n\nPart 1: Looking at the data\n\nWe have three datasets:\n\nrentals showing rental events and when those rentals were returned for a single product\nstock showing available stock levels for that product over time\nproduct_purchases showing how much was bought for each product and when"
